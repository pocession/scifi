# Test sandbox

This repository is a sandbox for app test. The input file `test.csv` is a small data set generated by our lab.

## Usage

- `Rscript --vanilla test.csv output`.
- `test.csv` is the joined result from preprocessed data and output is the name for this experiment.
- The App will create a folder with named `rds` and store the cleaned count matrix in `rds` object.
- The App will also create another folder named `output` and store the final result in 10X format. These three files `matrix.mtx, genes.tsv, barcodes.tsv` could be used for downstream analysis in other softwares such as [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html).
